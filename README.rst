.. code-block:: bash

    export SHANEMARTIN_SECRET='something-really-secret'

Ensure that you have Fabric installed on your system ::

    pip install fabric

Then run the following commands to bootstrap your environment.

::

    git clone https://github.com/shamrt/shanemartin
    cd shanemartin
    fab setup
    fab run

You will see a pretty welcome screen.

----------

In your production environment, set the ``SHANEMARTIN_ENV`` environment variable to ``"prod"``, i.e. ::

    export SHANEMARTIN_ENV='prod'

Then setup the application (see above) and freeze it ::

    fab freeze

    python manage.py shell

By default, you will have access to ``app``, ``db``, and the ``User`` model.
